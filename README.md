- Using fine-tuned object detection model (YOLOv4) for Lepidoptera to frame the exact location of specimen images
- Train [U-Net model from scratch](https://hackmd.io/@YungHuiHsu/Hkr3R3wV9)  for lepidopteran specimens for background removal 
- [Variational Sparse Coding (VSC)](https://hackmd.io/@YungHuiHsu/HJN5IL2gs) in Latent space based on variational autoencoders (VAEs) is used to improve feature interpretability for subsequent analysis of deep features
